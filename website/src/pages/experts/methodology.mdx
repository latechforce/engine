# Our Working Methodology

<MethodologyBlock emoji="⚙️">
  ## We automate existing processes and exclusively develop internal tools.

We listen to your needs and analyze your current processes to identify repetitive tasks that can be automated. Our goal is to optimize your time and resources by transforming these manual processes into efficient automated solutions.

</MethodologyBlock>

<MethodologyBlock emoji="💬">
  ## We are available to answer your questions, needs, and technical support.

Our team is here to understand your specific needs and support you in your projects. We take the time to respond to your requests, whether for technical questions, feature adjustments, or user support. This constant availability ensures smooth and effective collaboration.

</MethodologyBlock>

<MethodologyBlock emoji="🥇">
  ## We use the best of both code and No Code worlds.

We combine the advantages of traditional coding technologies and No Code solutions to provide you with tailor-made tools. This hybrid approach allows us to quickly develop effective solutions while ensuring maximum flexibility and adaptability. Whether you need a complex application requiring custom code or a quick solution based on No Code platforms, we select the best approach to meet your specific needs.

</MethodologyBlock>

<MethodologyBlock emoji="💻">
  ## We work remotely and asynchronously, using video conferencing when necessary.

Our remote work approach is based on clear and effective communication. We use powerful collaborative tools to maintain optimal workflow and ensure precise project tracking. Video conference meetings are strategically organized for key moments requiring direct interaction, such as project launches or important milestones.

</MethodologyBlock>

<MethodologyBlock emoji="⏱️">
  ## You pay for the time we spend on all your requests.

Our billing system is transparent and based on actual time spent on your projects. We meticulously record each intervention and provide you with a detailed report of our activities. This approach gives you complete control over your expenses and perfect visibility into your project progress. Time is rounded up to the nearest quarter hour, with no minimum, and billing is done monthly.

</MethodologyBlock>

<MethodologyBlock emoji="❌">
  ## We don't do estimates.

We prefer a pragmatic approach based on action rather than approximate predictions. Our experience shows that estimates are often a source of misunderstanding and can create unrealistic expectations. By working iteratively and transparently, we can better adapt our efforts to your real needs and adjust our approach based on feedback.

</MethodologyBlock>

<MethodologyBlock emoji="💎">
  ## We take the time to do quality work, focusing on what matters.

Our commitment to quality guides every aspect of our work. We favor a methodical and thoughtful approach, focusing on essential features that bring real added value to your business. This philosophy allows us to deliver robust and sustainable solutions while optimizing invested resources.

</MethodologyBlock>

<MethodologyBlock emoji="🏡">
  ## You own everything we develop for you.

All code, applications, and solutions developed as part of our services belong entirely to you. We provide you with complete access to sources and documentation, allowing you to maintain total independence. This transparency reflects our desire to build a lasting relationship of trust with our clients.

</MethodologyBlock>

<MethodologyBlock emoji="🕊️">
  ## You are not committed to anything.

Our flexible approach allows you to work with us according to your needs, without long-term contractual commitment. We believe that the quality of our work and our ability to meet your expectations are the best guarantees of a lasting collaboration. This freedom allows you to adjust your investment based on your priorities and the evolution of your projects.

</MethodologyBlock>

<MethodologyBlock emoji="❤️">
  ## We take care of you.

Your satisfaction is our priority. We don't just deliver a project: we commit to supporting you at every step, before, during, and after the implementation of your solutions. Whether it's answering your questions, training you on tool usage, or ensuring post-project follow-up, we are by your side to guarantee a smooth and stress-free experience. Our mission is to simplify technology so it becomes an asset in your daily life, while giving you peace of mind.
