‚è∫ Based on this comprehensive analysis, here are my top recommendations for improving DDD,
feature-based, and hexagonal architecture while maintaining excellent DX:

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvement Roadmap

1. Domain Events System (High Priority)

Implement a domain event system to decouple features and maintain loose coupling:

// Domain Events to replace cross-feature imports
export interface DomainEvent {
aggregateId: string
aggregateType: string
eventType: string
payload: unknown
occurredOn: Date
}

// Example: When a record is created
class RecordCreatedEvent implements DomainEvent {
constructor(
public aggregateId: string,
public aggregateType: 'table',
public eventType: 'record-created',
public payload: { tableId: string, recordId: string, fields: Record<string, unknown> },
public occurredOn: Date = new Date()
) {}
}

Benefits: Eliminates cross-feature imports, improves testability, enables event sourcing later.

2. Aggregate Boundary Definition (High Priority)

Define clear aggregate boundaries to improve encapsulation:

// Suggested Aggregate Structure:

- **Content Aggregate**: table + record + field (single aggregate root: Table)
- **Automation Aggregate**: automation + action + trigger (root: Automation)
- **Storage Aggregate**: bucket + object (root: Bucket)
- **Integration Aggregate**: connection + token (root: Connection)
- **Application Aggregate**: app + form + user (root: App)

3. Shared Kernel Pattern (Medium Priority)

Create a shared kernel for common value objects and prevent duplication:

// src/shared/domain/value-objects/
export class Id {
constructor(private readonly value: number) {
if (value <= 0) throw new Error('Id must be positive')
}
getValue(): number { return this.value }
}

export class Name {
constructor(private readonly value: string) {
if (value.length < 3) throw new Error('Name must be at least 3 characters')
}
getValue(): string { return this.value }
}

4. Repository Decomposition (Medium Priority)

Split large repositories into focused, single-responsibility services:

// Instead of one large ActionRepository, create:
export interface ICodeExecutionService {
executeTypeScript(code: string, inputData: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<unknown>
executeJavaScript(code: string, inputData: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<unknown>
}

export interface IHttpService {
get(url: string, headers?: Record<string, string>): Promise<unknown>
post(url: string, body: unknown, headers?: Record<string, string>): Promise<unknown>
}

export interface IIntegrationService {
execute(integration: IntegrationAction, connection: Connection): Promise<unknown>
}

5. Anti-Corruption Layers (Medium Priority)

Add anti-corruption layers for external services to protect domain integrity:

// Anti-corruption layer for external APIs
export class AirtableAntiCorruptionLayer {
toDomainRecord(airtableRecord: AirtableApiRecord): Record {
return new Record(
new Id(airtableRecord.id),
this.mapFields(airtableRecord.fields)
)
}

    private mapFields(airtableFields: unknown): Field[] {
      // Transform external format to domain format
    }

}

6. Feature Contracts (Low Priority)

Define explicit contracts between features to prevent coupling:

// Feature contracts instead of direct imports
export interface TableContract {
recordCreated: (event: RecordCreatedEvent) => void
recordUpdated: (event: RecordUpdatedEvent) => void
}

export interface AutomationContract {
triggerAutomation: (event: TriggerEvent) => void
}

7. Improved Dependency Injection (Low Priority)

Enhance the factory pattern with proper constructor injection:

// Better DI in controllers
export class TableController {
constructor(
private readonly listTablesUseCase: ListTablesUseCase,
private readonly createRecordUseCase: CreateRecordUseCase,
private readonly eventPublisher: DomainEventPublisher
) {}

    async createRecord(c: Context<HonoType>) {
      const result = await this.createRecordUseCase.execute(input)
      // Publish domain event instead of direct coupling
      this.eventPublisher.publish(new RecordCreatedEvent(...))
      return c.json(result)
    }

}

üöÄ Developer Experience Enhancements

1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

# ADR-001: Domain Events for Feature Decoupling

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Cross-feature imports create tight coupling between features

## Decision

Implement domain events to enable loose coupling

## Consequences

- Improved testability
- Better separation of concerns
- Slightly more complex event flow

2. Code Generation for Boilerplate

// CLI command: bun generate:feature <name>
// Generates: domain/, application/, infrastructure/, interface/ with templates

3. Architecture Testing

// Automated architecture tests
describe('Architecture Rules', () => {
it('should not have cross-feature imports in domain layer', () => {
const domainFiles = glob('src/features/_/domain/\*\*/_.ts')
domainFiles.forEach(file => {
const imports = getImports(file)
expect(imports).not.toMatch(/\.\.\/\.\.\/.\*\/features\//)
})
})
})

4. Enhanced Documentation

- Feature maps: Visual diagrams showing feature boundaries
- Event flow diagrams: How domain events flow between features
- Onboarding guides: Step-by-step guides for new developers
